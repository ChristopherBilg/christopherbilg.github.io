                I thought it might be fitting to write a blog post as my time at Arizona State University draws to an
                end while a new chapter in my life starts to unfold. It is both bittersweet and exhilarating to be
                finishing this program after two years. While I sit and think about this time, a few overarching
                questions come to mind. Below is a list of the coursework that I completed during this program (in
                chronological order):
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>CSE 551: Foundations of Algorithms</li>
                <li>CSE 511: Data Processing at Scale</li>
                <li>CSE 545: Software Security</li>
                <li>CSE 548: Advanced Computer Network Security</li>
                <li>CSE 539: Applied Cryptography</li>
                <li>CSE 543: Information Assurance & Security</li>
                <li>CSE 578: Data Visualization</li>
                <li>CSE 598: Topic - Engineering Blockchain Application</li>
                <li>CSE 565: Software Verification, Validation, and Testing</li>
                <li>CSE 598: Topic - Advanced Software Analysis and Design</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What did I expect to gain from my time in this program?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                From the day I entered the Master of Computer Science (Cybersecurity Concentration) program at ASU, I
                had the full expectation that I would gain a deeper understanding of a few select areas of the computer
                science field. I wanted to delve much deeper into the cybersecurity discipline, including areas such as:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Web application security</li>
                <li>Binary application security</li>
                <li>Network security</li>
                <li>Organizational cybersecurity</li>
                <li>Industry standards and best practices</li>
                <li>Various smaller topics</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>What am I taking away from this program after all?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                I have learned more than I could have imagined in the past two years. While not all of my new knowledge
                can be attributed to this program, almost all of the security-related subject matter areas that I am now
                competent in, come directly from the coursework and academic papers that I have worked on during this
                program. I worked full-time as a software engineer while completing my studies and thus I have gained a
                ton of directly applicable skills.
            </p>

            <p class="indent">
                I am also taking away the ability to adapt and persevere "when the going gets tough". I like to think
                that I am a flexible and generally fairly resilient person. Now I know that my thinking was accurate.
                When you start a graduate-level program, many people will tell you that it is a marathon and not a
                sprint. In my opinion, this couldn't be more accurate. This is especially true for anybody that wishes
                to complete a graduate program while working in another full-time position.
            </p>

            <h2>Has my time spent in this program shaped and/or changed me as a person?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                I don't think that I've been shaped and/or changed directly by this program; however, that isn't to say
                that I haven't changed as a person during this time. I wouldn't have put much consideration into Ph.D.
                programs if it wasn't for the great satisfaction that came from my M.C.S. program. I gained immeasurable
                respect and admiration for both higher-education teaching and research. Now, I do have some research
                methods in mind that aren't exactly&hellip; traditional, but they are research nevertheless.
            </p>

            <h2>What do I wish I could have gained from this program?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                While I did enjoy this program very much, I was left feeling slightly underwhelmed by the rigor and
                depth than I expected at the start. The most glaring thing that I would change about this program is
                that I feel that the difficulty should be turned up a notch, or two. While some courses had a ton of
                depth to them, the majority (~7) exhibited a lack thereof.
            </p>

            <h2>Given the chance, would I go through this program again?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                Given the ability to go back in time and choose a master's program, I think that I would opt for one of
                the others that I was accepted into. One of which is the Master of Science in Computer Science program
                at Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). From my communications with graduates of both
                programs, it seems that Georgia Tech's program has the rigor and research that I, quite possibly didn't
                know at the time, was looking for.
            </p>

            <h2>What are my future academic plans, if any?</h2>

            <p class="indent">
                For now, I am content with working one full-time position as my fianc√© and I are expecting our
                firstborn. I do have a passionate interest in research and, I'm sure, will one day reach for my Ph.D.
                but that is for another day.
