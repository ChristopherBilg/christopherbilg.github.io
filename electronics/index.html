        <p>
          Most recently I worked on the modules for light sensors, distance sensors, and WS2812B LED strips. The light
          sensors and distance sensors proved quite straight forward, with each having a single input and a single
          output pin.
        </p>

        <p>
          The WS2812B LED strips, however, proved to be a bit more challenging. I had to do a bit of research to figure
          out how to properly interface with the WS2812B LEDs. I found a few libraries that I could use, and ended up
          using the FastLED library. I also found a few examples of how to use the FastLED library, which helped me
          figure out how to properly interface with the WS2812B LEDs and create the output that is shown in the image
          below.

          The following enhancements have been made while I start writing 3 new modules. The 3 new modules are for light
          sensors, distance sensors, and WS2812B LED strips.

                I have found in my career that the best documentation, which also happens to be the most up-to-date, is

                Let's just admit it already, we all hate testing. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that it isn't
                incredibly useful at times. PlatformIO happens to have a built-in test harness, so it's hard to come up
                with an excuse not to implement some form of testing.

          My next electronics update should, hopefully, be in regards to the 3 new modules that I

        <p>
          Using the 3 ESP-WROOM-32 development boards that I ordered, I set up a wireless mesh network. I used the
          painlessMesh library to set up the mesh network and I'm current refactoring the code into a modularized
          version so that I can easily add more functionality to the mesh network. I must say, I'm very impressed with
          the painlessMesh library. It's very, very easy to use and it's very well documented. I'm also impressed with
          how seamlessly I was able to spin up a FreeRTOS task that handles the logic for the mesh network and I can
          send/receive messages to/from the mesh network from other tasks by using a single FreeRTOS queue.
        </p>

        <p>
          As it stands today, I have a wireless mesh network setup with some simple serialized communication which
          allows one device to accept input from a button, send that input to the other devices in the mesh network, and
          then display the input status as the HIGH/LOW state of an LED.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm eyeing up WS2812B light strips, which are individually-addressable RGB LEDs. I'm thinking about getting a
          few of these from different vendors in order to test them out and see which ones, if any, have the best
          quality. My first short-term project is to get a few of these light strips working with my mesh network so
          that I can display a miniature light show for my daughter. I really like the idea that WS2812B light strips
          can be cut to any length (as well as daisy-chained) and they can be controlled with a single data pin! Without
          having them in my hands to play around with, this sounds like such a great way to manipulate the LEDs.

        <hr />

        <p>
          I decided to try to get a 4-digit 8-segment display working with my Arduino Uno. I'm using this display as a
          sort of proof of concept that my breadboard and Arduino are working properly. I'm also using this as an
          opportunity to learn more about inter-task communication and synchronization with FreeRTOS.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know, I know, I'm setting out to explore and learn about hardware, but I'm still fidling with software. I
          promise I'll get to the hardware soon, but I want to make sure I have a solid foundation for my development
          environment, libraries, and tooling before I start working on more complex projects. I'm keeping note of a
          list of potential projects that I want to work on, such as a wirelessly accessible set of lights for my home
          office that I can send an asynchronous message to to enable/disable, change the color, and change the
          brightness.
        </p>

        <p>
          I now have multitasking working along with inter-task communication and synchronization via FreeRTOS queues. I
          recently ordered 3 ESP-WROOM-32 development boards, so I'm excited to start working with those and
          experimenting with wireless communication. I'm also planning on getting a few more sensors and actuators to
          play around with. I'm thinking about getting a few temperature and humidity sensors, servos, and a few
          different types of motors. I'm also planning on getting a few different types of displays, such as an OLED
          display and a TFT display. For now I'll figure out wireless communication and getting the 3 ESP-WROOM-32
          boards interfacing with each other.

        <p>
          Welcome to my little internet hole where I plan on sharing my adventures into the world of electronics. I
          started this journey in 2023, when I decided that my hardware skills were lacking where my software skills
          were strong. I have always been interested in electronics, but I never prioritized learning about them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have many ambitious ideas that I want to work on, but I am starting small. I currently own an off-brand
          Arduino Uno kit, but I plan on expanding my collection of tools as I learn more. I am very interested in the
          intersection of hardware and software, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
        </p>

        <p>
          My current hardware setup is shown in the image below. I have a breadboard with a few LEDs, resistors, and
          wires. As far as software goes, I'm using VSCode with the PlatformIO extension. I'm also using the FreeRTOS
          library to aid with multitasking and to learn more about how real-time operating systems work.
        </p>
