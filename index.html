        <p>
          Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Chris Bilger and I am a
          husband, father, engineer, educator, and leader. I currently work as a
          Software Engineer at Lockheed Martin where I design, build, test, and
          deploy full-stack applications for various enterprises.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am extremely passionate about continuous learning, teaching,
          discovering, and building in all facets of my life. From my
          professional career in software engineering to my personal life and
          hobbies, I want to learn something new every day, and share that new
          knowledge with others. I curated a long-term roadmap for creating
          tools to help make people's lives better, easier, safer, more
          efficient, etc.

        <p>
          I have extensive experience working on fast-paced, high-output Agile
          teams using both Scrum and Kanban methodologies. From self-hosted
          GitLab instances running CI/CD pipelines to full Atlassian suite
          production environments, I have the skillset and know-how to
          architecture, plan, and implement such complex, dynamic systems.
        </p>

        <p>
          Being a full-stack software engineer gives me the express
          responsibility to keep up-to-date with the latest trends in frontend,
          middleware, and backend web development technologies. I've worked
          professionally with the following tech stacks: MERN, MEVN, Django,
          Java Springboot, AWS, Azure, and many others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am most proficient with React and Vue as frontend frameworks,
          Express JS as middleware, and both NodeJS and Django on the backend.
          As far as databases go, all types of SQL and NoSQL databases are
          within my abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have experience in many areas of software engineering and I'm
          constantly learning new frameworks, methodologies, tech stacks,
          development workflows, and processes. I put an extremely high emphasis
          on well-written and thought-out code as well as code that is
          documented, linted, formatted, style checked, etc. I truly believe
          that if you're going to do something (in this case software
          engineering), do it right the first time.
